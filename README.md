# Face Spoof Detection in real time Face Recognition | Android
Face spoof detection in face recognition systems using Image Distortion Analysis

- Binary classifier (SVM) is used to detect real and fake faces
- Pre trained Famous Cascading classifier is used to detect faces over input frames
- Two feature vector {blur,edges} is used to train the svm classifier
